### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tommy. I have an educational background in cybersecurity and some python. I graduated right when covid lockdowns began and never got the opportunity to work in the field I studied. Since then I've continued to grow my understanding in python and javascript.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and Java
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my family!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tommyhadyen78@gmail.com
